# GBG_Python_course: isotope_counter.py
Project work for the "Python for biologists" course.
This is a program created to estimate the presence of non-standard isotopes in a peptide. It accepts an amino acid sequence as an input and calculates the number of 2H, 13C, 15N, 18O and 34S isotopes.
Currently it takes no arguments, te sequence needs to be pasted to the command line after running the script. An improved version reading input from files and Uniprot IDs is currently in development.
